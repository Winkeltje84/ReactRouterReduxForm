# Redux Weather App

This is a repo for tracking my steps in the Modern React with Redux Udemy course by Stephen Grider.

For this excersize I am going to create React Single Page Application, that will communicate with a Redux Blog Post API (http://reduxblog.herokuapp.com/) and will give the user the possibility to use the site as if it was a multiple page application.

## Current state
